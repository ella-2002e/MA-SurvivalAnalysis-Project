### Problem Statement:
In the modern business landscape, companies across diverse sectors struggle with shared
challenges. These include customer churn, revenue instability, resource allocation complexities,
pricing optimization, and the imperative for personalized customer experiences. Customer churn,
signifying the loss of clientele over time, threatens the businessâ€™s continuity. Revenue volatility,
shaped by dynamic markets and shifting consumer behaviors, introduces financial uncertainties.
Personalizing customer experiences has become a fundamental requirement, necessitating a deep
understanding of individual preferences and behaviors. These are just a few examples of the
many challenges companies face in today's business world, so innovative solutions to address
these pressing issues are needed.
Understanding customer behavior, reducing churn, and maximizing the lifetime value of
customers may affect these problems in a positive way. Our project aims to build a
comprehensive model that conducts survival analysis for companies, predicts churn rates, and
estimates customer lifetime value (CLV).

### Users of the project:
The target audience for this project includes a wide range of businesses, such as subscription
services, e-commerce, finance, banking, insurance, and more, looking to analyze customer
behavior and make data-driven decisions. These businesses seek a solution to understand and
mitigate churn, improve revenue stability, allocate resources optimally, and enhance customer
personalization.
